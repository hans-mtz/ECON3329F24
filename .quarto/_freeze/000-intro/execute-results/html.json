Both affect the behavoir of economic agents (consumers, firms), \n    - Alter the structure and functioning of markets\n    - Influence economic growth\n    - Redistribute income across individuals\n- Focus of the course: Microeconomic (individual behavior) and Normative (how things should be; Positive: how things are)\n\n\n\n\n## Current Global Fiscal Policy Debates\n\n- **Taxation of Digital Economy**: How to tax multinational tech companies that operate across borders.\n- **Climate Change Financing**: Debates on funding climate initiatives through taxes or government spending.\n- **Wealth Inequality**: Discussions on progressive taxation to address rising wealth disparities.\n- **Sovereign Debt Management**: Strategies for managing and reducing national debts, especially post-COVID-19.\n\n\n## Taxation of Digital Economy\n\n::: {#fig-mismatch}\n\n![](figs/f1.png)\n\nThere is a geographic mismatch between the location of individuals who use digital platforms and the location where those products are developed.\n\n:::\n\n[Source](https://taxfoundation.org/research/all/global/digital-taxation/){.footer}\n\n\n## Taxation of Digital Economy\n\n- Unlike traditional companies, whose profits are taxed at value creation, digital technology companies conduct most transactions **electronically**. \n- This makes it challenging to capture **where value is created**, what it is, and how to measure it.\n\n## Taxation of Digital Economy\n\n- Additionally, companies are taxed through permanent establishment rules, which are largely based on **physical presence**. \n- So, while digital technology companies operate virtually all over the globe, their profits are taxed only in the state where they have a physical establishment.\n- What economic effects might this have?\n\n[Source](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/taxing-the-digital-economy-its-complicated/){.footer}\n\n\n## Digital Service Tax (DST) in Canada\n\n- The Digital Services Tax will be effective the 2024 calendar year\n- The DST is a 3% tax on Canadian‑source digital services revenue earned by large domestic and foreign taxpayers\n\n## Digital Service Tax (DST) in Canada\n\n- In‑scope revenue would generally be comprised of Canadian-source digital services revenue arising from:\n    - online marketplace services\n    - online advertising services\n    - social media services\n    - the sale or licensing of user data obtained from an online marketplace, a social media platform or an online search engine\n\n\n[Source](https://www.pwc.com/ca/en/services/tax/publications/tax-insights/dst-act-is-now-law-2024.html#){.footer}\n\n\n## Canada's Fiscal Policy and Taxation Issues\n\n- **Tax System Overhaul**: Calls for a comprehensive review of the Canadian tax system, last overhauled in 1967, to simplify and ensure fairness in taxation.\n- **Carbon Pricing**: Ongoing debates around the effectiveness and fairness of carbon pricing mechanisms in reducing emissions and their economic impact.\n- **Tax Avoidance and Evasion**: Increased focus on combating aggressive tax avoidance, particularly involving offshore entities and digital currencies.\n\n## Canada's Fiscal Policy and Taxation Issues\n\n- **Transfer Pricing**: Scrutiny of cross-border transactions to ensure fair taxation of multinational corporations operating in Canada.\n- **Public Debt Concerns**: Managing rising public debt and interest payments, especially in light of increased government spending on social programs and infrastructure.\n\n\n## Canadian Issue: Carbon Pricing\n\n- Canada’s carbon pricing system is a cornerstone of the country's plan to tackle climate change. \n\n- However, it faces criticism regarding its economic impact, fairness, and effectiveness in reducing emissions\n\n- Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre argues against the carbon tax saying it makes current inflation worse\n\n[Source](https://www.canada.ca/en/services/environment/weather/climatechange/climate-action/pricing-carbon-pollution/how-pricing-reduces-emissions.html){.footer}\n\n## What is the Carbon Pricing (Tax)?\n\n- There are two systems for pricing carbon in Canada: the fuel charge applied to consumers, and another system applied to industrial emitters. \n\n- The April 1 (last) increase amounts to about three cents more per litre of gasoline. \n\n- By 2030, though, the price on carbon would add nearly 40 cents per litre\n\n- The gradual increases are meant to act as a financial incentive for people and businesses to change their behaviour to burn less fossil fuels and transition to greener forms of energy.\n    - Switch from a gas-powered vehicle to an electric.\n\n[Source](https://www.cbc.ca/news/climate/carbon-tax-controversy-1.7151551){.footer}\n\n\n## Does the Carbon Tax Work?\n\n![](figs/emission-2030.png){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n[Source](https://440megatonnes.ca/insight/industrial-carbon-pricing-systems-driver-emissions-reductions/){.footer}\n\n## Does the Carbon Tax Work?\n\n- A recent study estimates the the fuel charge will contribute between 8 and 9 percent of avoided emission by 2030\n\n- The industrial-emitter carbon pricing will contribute between 23-39 percent\n\n- Data released in by the Federal Government shows, however, by 2030 the reduction in emissions is expected to be 12 per cent below what emissions would be without carbon pricing\n\n- On the economic side, by 2030 Canada's GDP will be $25 billion lower that it would have been without carbon pricing\n\n## Carbon Rebate\n\n- The carbon tax applies to residents in Newfoundland and Labrador, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island, Ontario, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta, Yukon and Nunavut.\n\n- Ninety per cent of the government revenues are returned to households in those provinces through a quarterly rebate program, with households receiving a quarterly payment based on family size.\n\n## Carbon Rebate\n\n\n![](figs/carbon-rebate.png){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n\n[Source](https://www.canada.ca/en/services/environment/weather/climatechange/climate-action/pricing-carbon-pollution/how-pricing-reduces-emissions.html){.footer}\n\n## How Carbon Pricing Works\n\n\n{{< video https://youtu.be/zD64kaTY5Vg width=\"100%\" height=\"85%\" >}}\n\n\n\n# How Does Canada Tax Code Rank?\n\n## International Tax Competitiveness Index\n\n- The Tax Foundation' s International Tax Competitiveness Index (ITCI) measures the degree to which the 38 OECD countries' tax systems promote competitiveness\n\n- The ITCI attempts to display not only which countries provide the best tax environment for investment but also the best tax environment for workers and businesses.\n\n- Canada ranks 15 in the OECD\n\n## \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Canada's Rank at the International Tax Competitive Index](000-intro_files/figure-revealjs/fig-can-rank-1.png){#fig-can-rank width=960}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Sources of Revenue\n\n![](figs/revenue.png){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n## Corporate Taxation\n\n![](figs/corp-tax.png){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n[The corporate income tax is a tax on the profits of corporations.]{.footer}\n\n## Consumption Taxes\n\n- Consumption taxes are charged on goods and services and can take various forms. \n\n- In the OECD and most of the world, the value-added tax (VAT) is the most common consumption tax. \n\n## Consumption Taxes\n\n![](figs/vat.png){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n## Taxes in Canada\n\n[Taxes in Canada](https://taxfoundation.org/location/canada/){fig-align=\"center\"}",
