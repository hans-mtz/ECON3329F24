## Taxation of Digital Economy

- Unlike traditional companies, whose profits are taxed at value creation, digital technology companies conduct most transactions **electronically**. 
- This makes it challenging to capture **where value is created**, what it is, and how to measure it.

## Taxation of Digital Economy

- Additionally, companies are taxed through permanent establishment rules, which are largely based on **physical presence**. 
- So, while digital technology companies operate virtually all over the globe, their profits are taxed only in the state where they have a physical establishment.
- What economic effects might this have?

## Canada's Fiscal Policy and Taxation Issues

- **Tax System Overhaul**: Calls for a comprehensive review of the Canadian tax system, last overhauled in 1967, to simplify and ensure fairness in taxation.
- **Carbon Pricing**: Ongoing debates around the effectiveness and fairness of carbon pricing mechanisms in reducing emissions and their economic impact.
- **Tax Avoidance and Evasion**: Increased focus on combating aggressive tax avoidance, particularly involving offshore entities and digital currencies.

## Canada's Fiscal Policy and Taxation Issues

- **Transfer Pricing**: Scrutiny of cross-border transactions to ensure fair taxation of multinational corporations operating in Canada.
- **Public Debt Concerns**: Managing rising public debt and interest payments, especially in light of increased government spending on social programs and infrastructure.


## Canadian Issue: Carbon Pricing

- Canada’s carbon pricing system is a cornerstone of the country's plan to tackle climate change. 

- However, it faces criticism regarding its economic impact, fairness, and effectiveness in reducing emissions

- Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre argues against the carbon tax saying it makes current inflation worse

## What is the Carbon Pricing (Tax)?

- There are two systems for pricing carbon in Canada: the fuel charge applied to consumers, and another system applied to industrial emitters. 

- The April 1 (last) increase amounts to about three cents more per litre of gasoline. 

- By 2030, though, the price on carbon would add nearly 40 cents per litre

- The gradual increases are meant to act as a financial incentive for people and businesses to change their behaviour to burn less fossil fuels and transition to greener forms of energy.
    - Switch from a gas-powered vehicle to an electric.

## Does the Carbon Tax Work?

![](figs/emission-2030.png){fig-align="center"}

[Source](https://440megatonnes.ca/insight/industrial-carbon-pricing-systems-driver-emissions-reductions/){.footer}

## Does the Carbon Tax Work?

- A recent study estimates the the fuel charge will contribute between 8 and 9 percent of avoided emission by 2030

- The industrial-emitter carbon pricing will contribute between 23-39 percent

- Data released in by the Federal Government shows, however, by 2030 the reduction in emissions is expected to be 12 per cent below what emissions would be without carbon pricing

- On the economic side, by 2030 Canada's GDP will be $25 billion lower that it would have been without carbon pricing

## Carbon Rebate

- The carbon tax applies to residents in Newfoundland and Labrador, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island, Ontario, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta, Yukon and Nunavut.

- Ninety per cent of the government revenues are returned to households in those provinces through a quarterly rebate program, with households receiving a quarterly payment based on family size.

# How Does Canada Tax Code Rank?

## International Tax Competitiveness Index

- The Tax Foundation' s International Tax Competitiveness Index (ITCI) measures the degree to which the 38 OECD countries' tax systems promote competitiveness

- The ITCI attempts to display not only which countries provide the best tax environment for investment but also the best tax environment for workers and businesses.

- Canada ranks 15 in the OECD
